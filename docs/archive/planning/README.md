# Archived Planning Documents

This directory contains **historical planning documents** from Morphogen's development. These are preserved for reference but are no longer actively maintained.

## Purpose

These documents represent:
- **Past strategic planning** (Q4 2025 roadmaps, release plans)
- **Completed analyses** (domain value analysis, capability frameworks)
- **Evolution strategies** (architectural roadmaps, selective evolution)
- **Implementation tracking** (domain progress logs)

They capture the thinking and planning from specific points in time but have been **superseded by the unified roadmap**.

## Contents

### Roadmap Documents (2025-11)
- `ROADMAP_2025_Q4.md` - Q4 2025 12-week tactical plan
- `MORPHOGEN_RELEASE_PLAN.md` - Original v1.0 24-week release plan
- `PATH_FORWARD_OVERVIEW.md` - Long-term strategic vision through 2027
- `implementation-progress.md` - Domain implementation progress tracking

### Strategic Analysis Documents
- `DOMAIN_VALUE_ANALYSIS.md` - ROI analysis of different domains
- `ARCHITECTURAL_EVOLUTION_ROADMAP.md` - Architecture evolution planning
- `MORPHOGEN_SELECTIVE_EVOLUTION.md` - Selective evolution strategy
- `CAPABILITY_GROWTH_FRAMEWORK.md` - Capability growth framework
- `SHOWCASE_OUTPUT_STRATEGY.md` - Output and demonstration strategy

## Current Planning

For **active, maintained planning documentation**, see:
- **Primary**: [/docs/ROADMAP.md](../../ROADMAP.md) - Unified roadmap (v0.12.0 → v1.0)
- **Status**: [/STATUS.md](../../../STATUS.md) - Current implementation status
- **Domains**: [/docs/DOMAINS.md](../../DOMAINS.md) - Domain catalog

## Notes

- These documents are **frozen** - they won't be updated
- They're useful for understanding **past decisions** and **project evolution**
- Information from these docs has been **consolidated** into the unified roadmap
- If you're planning new work, use the current roadmap, not these archives
