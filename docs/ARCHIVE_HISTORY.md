## Consolidation Summary

### Session heating-dawn-0316 (2026-03-16)
**Document Reduction**: ~117 → ~100 docs (-15%)

**Archived to `~/Archive/morphogen/docs-archive/2026-03-16/`:**

| File | Reason |
|------|--------|
| `docs/DOMAINS.md` | Broken: contained raw paste of README.md lines 304–1046, not a real doc |
| `docs/troubleshooting.md` | Pre-rename era: references "Creative Computation DSL v0.2.2 MVP" |
| `docs/guides/DOMAIN_FINISHING_GUIDE.md` | Obsolete: described work to finish 23 half-finished domains; all 39 are now complete |
| `docs/guides/DOMAIN_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` | Obsolete: "Status: Planning" — migration to `@operator` system is complete since v0.12.0 |
| `docs/architecture/domain-architecture.md` | Pre-implementation design doc (108KB, 3,159 lines); references TiaCAD/Kairo/v0.7 milestones; superseded by actual code + specs + ADRs |
| `docs/examples/emergence-cross-domain.md` | Design doc (Status: Design Document); examples not verified to run |
| `docs/examples/j-tube-firepit-multiphysics.md` | Design doc (Status: Design Document); motivated domain creation, now historical only |

**Rewrote:**
- `docs/getting-started.md` — updated from v0.6/v0.7 to v0.12.0; switched primary interface from DSL to Python API; fixed `morphogen --version` → `morphogen version`; added canonical examples as the first programs to try

**Updated:**
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` — test count 1,705→1,912, operator count 606→612, P0 items marked done
- `docs/README.md` — added `usage/` section; removed archived example links
- `docs/DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md` — reflects archive, updates counts

- `KAIRO_RENAME_ANALYSIS.md` - Kairo→Morphogen rename analysis (historical)
- `README.md` - Analysis directory index

---

## Why These Were Archived

### Session Artifacts
- **Point-in-time snapshots** capturing specific development moments
- Not intended as living documentation
- Valuable for understanding project history and decisions
- Clutter active docs if kept in repository

### Historical Planning
- **Information consolidated** into unified `/docs/ROADMAP.md`
- Multiple overlapping roadmaps created confusion
- Archived versions preserve historical context without duplication
- Canonical roadmap is now single source of truth

### Analysis Reports
- **Outdated information** referencing v0.8.0 (current: v0.12.0+)
- Original domain counts (14 domains → now 39 domains)
- Original test counts (580 tests → now 1,705 tests)
- Useful for historical reference, but misleading if treated as current

## How to Use Archived Documents

### For Historical Context
```bash
cd ~/Archive/morphogen/
ls -R  # Browse archived content
```

### For Understanding Past Decisions
- Check session artifacts to see what was learned during development
- Review planning archives to understand how priorities evolved
- Read analysis reports to see how codebase structure developed

### When NOT to Use Archives
- ❌ Don't reference archived docs as current documentation
- ❌ Don't link to archived locations from active docs
- ❌ Don't treat archived snapshots as canonical information
- ✅ Always use living docs in `/docs/` for current info

---

## Archive Maintenance

### When to Archive
- Session summary documents (after session completes)
- Superseded planning documents (when consolidated)
- Point-in-time analyses (when outdated by new releases)
- Duplicate documentation (when consolidated elsewhere)

### When NOT to Archive
- Living reference documentation
- Active specifications
- Current guides and examples
- Architectural decisions (ADRs) - keep these in `/docs/adr/`

---

- 3.1MB total documentation (16% size reduction)
- Clearer separation: active vs. historical
- Single canonical roadmap
- Session artifacts properly archived
- Music docs organized in subdirectory
- No broken stubs or duplicates

**After Session 2 (enchanted-hero-0105):**
- 120 markdown files in `/docs/` (23% total reduction from start)

- All cross-references validated and updated
- Orphaned directories removed (philbrick-bridge, meta)
- Documentation navigation fully coherent

**After Session 3 (crimson-twilight-0105):**
- 117 markdown files in `/docs/` (25% total reduction from start)

- Added implementation status badges to remaining research specs
- Removed duplicate operator-registry-expansion.md (consolidated into operator-registry.md)

### Session 4 (rupejo-0122, 2026-01-22)
**Document Reduction**: 117 → 116 docs (-1 doc, -1 directory)
**Focus**: Cleanup of completed planning docs, directory consolidation

**Archived to `~/Archive/morphogen/docs-archive/2026-01-22/`**:
- `planning/3D_VISUALIZATION_SYSTEM_PLAN.md` → Implementation complete (26 operators, 55 tests)

**Directory Consolidation**:
- Removed `docs/physics/` (single-file directory)
- Moved `superconductivity-computational-strategy.md` → `use-cases/`

**Index Improvements**:
- Expanded `specifications/README.md` with full categorized index (25 specs)
- Added missing `domain-mesh-catalog.md` to `reference/README.md`
- Fixed outdated "Critical Blocker" in ROADMAP.md (3D viz is complete)
- Fixed 5 broken references to archived/moved files

**Impact:**
- Reduced documentation load for new contributors
- Clearer navigation for active documentation
- Historical context preserved but not in the way
- Easier to maintain canonical information
- Clear distinction between implemented vs proposed specs
