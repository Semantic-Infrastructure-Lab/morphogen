# Guides

Step-by-step guides for implementing and extending Morphogen.

## Available Guides

### [Domain Finishing Guide](DOMAIN_FINISHING_GUIDE.md) ⭐ NEW
**Complete roadmap for finishing existing domains** (Python → Production-Ready):
- The 5 levels of completion
- Current gap analysis (23 domains, most at Level 1)
- 10-month master timeline
- Level-by-level finishing steps
- Per-domain checklists
- Success metrics

**Use this guide if:** You want to understand what "finishing" means and the plan to get all 23 domains production-ready.

### [Domain Implementation Guide](domain-implementation.md)
Complete guide for implementing a **new** domain in Morphogen:
- Domain design principles
- Operator implementation
- Integration with existing domains
- Testing and validation
- Documentation requirements

**Use this guide if:** You're adding a brand new domain (Level 0 → Level 5).

### [Analysis and Visualization Guide](analysis-visualization.md) ⭐ NEW
**Complete guide for analyzing and visualizing Morphogen simulations**:
- Built-in analysis capabilities (audio_analysis, signal, graph domains)
- Modal decomposition with PyDMD (external workflow)
- Creating showcase animations (mode galleries, cross-domain comparison)
- Spectral analysis workflows
- Best practices for data export and visualization

**Use this guide if:** You want to understand simulation dynamics, create explanatory animations, or perform advanced analysis.
